        <ol>
            <li>Prepare pig, make little cuts on thicker parts of pig and pour salt in them, after you put it in cuts, take more salt and rub it all around it</li>
            <li>Then you need to take a little bit of pork fat and rub it over the pig, all around so it gets even more juicy</li>
            <li>Sal the insides of pig and add hefty amount of fat in there, after you do that you need to saw it up</li>
            <li>Use butchers twine and do the zig zag pattern</li>
            <li>After you do that you need to put pig on the spit and start roasting it</li>
            <li>When you start the fire you need to use all the twigs you have so you have good ground for fire</li>
            <li>Concetrate fire around thick parts of pig, like shoulders and thighs, not the stomach</li>
            <li>For 13kg pig you need to roast it for about 3 and a half hours</li>
            <li>When it's done you take one beer and shake it hard so that when you open it, it all explodes on the pig</li>
            <li>Other beer is for you for all hard work you do</li>
            <li>After that you need to remove it from fire and let it sit for a little bit and then dig right in</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
